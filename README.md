## Description of the data 
**comment: if the report directly refers to the content from other sources, remember to specify it. For example, 'courtesy to https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data for supplying the descriptions for the data'**

The data set is sourced from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data

As of today September 28, the data set contains 119875 observations. 

The data set has a total of 65 columns.

Some interesting predictors are 'new_cases' - the new Covid-19 cases on a given day, 'new_vaccinations' - the number of newly vaccinated people on the given day, 'people_vaccinated' - the total number of people that have been vaccinated and 'hosp_patients' and 'icu_patients', the number of patients in hospital and specifically in intensive care unit respectively. 

The complete list of variables are listed below:

For countries that don't report vaccination data on a daily basis, we assume that vaccination changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures, which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window |
| `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`        | Total number of COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people in the total population                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Precise description of the question(s)

We would like to be able to model future Covid-19 cases on a given day and determine the variables in the above dataset that can best explain the number of cases that will occur.

## Why this question/dataset

Different countries have different vaccination rates and economical and sociopolitical environments, Covid-19 is a serious issue currently and it can be of great insight to predict future Covid-19 cases. This question seems interesting as it would potentially be very useful to understand the factors that are causing a sudden rise or fall in cases and perhaps be able to determine if factors like amount of people vaccinated, gdp, population density can affect the number of cases that are occuring. The dataset itself is very complete with several useful variables that may influence the susceptibility of a population to Covid-19 spread.

# Checkpoint 1 grade

(5 / 5)



# Checkpoint 2 grade

__Total__ (28 / 30)

__Words__ (6 / 6) The text is laid out cleanly, with clear divisions
and transitions between sections and sub-sections. The writing itself
is well-organized, free of grammatical and other mechanical errors,
divided into complete sentences logically grouped into paragraphs and
sections, and easy to follow from the presumed level of knowledge. 

__Numbers__ (1 / 1) All numerical results or summaries are reported to
suitable precision, and with appropriate measures of uncertainty
attached when applicable. 

__Pictures__ (6 / 7) Figures and tables are easy to read, with
informative captions, ~axis labels~ and legends, and are placed near the
relevant pieces of text or referred to with convenient labels. 

__Code__ (3 / 4) The code is formatted and organized so that it is easy
for others to read and understand. It is indented, ~commented~, and uses
meaningful names. It only includes computations which are actually
needed to answer the analytical questions, and avoids redundancy. Code
borrowed from the notes, from books, or from resources found online is
explicitly acknowledged and sourced in the comments. Functions or
procedures not directly taken from the notes have accompanying tests
which check whether the code does what it is supposed to. The text of
the report is free of intrusive blocks of code. With regards to R Markdown,
all calculations are actually done in the file as it knits, and only
relevant results are shown.

__Exploratory data analysis__ (12 / 12) Variables are examined individually and
bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate
figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and
potential models is clearly explained.

1. https://learning.github.ubc.ca/STAT-406-101-2021W/project-husky/blob/3a7cdc4097b158d23a8d6dd28b18cbfed7e9e8a8/report.Rmd#L337 Good job on using dplyr and ggplot to write clean code. However, it lacks comments of what you are doing to restructure/manipulate the dataset.

follow from the presumed level of knowledge.

__Exploratory Data Analysis__ (12 / 12) Variables are examined individually and
bivariately. Features/observations are discussed with appropriate
figure or tables. The relevance of the EDA to the questions and
potential models is clearly explained.

__Results and analysis__ (25 / 25) The statistical summaries
are clearly related to, or possibly derive from, the substantive questions of interest.  Any
assumptions are checked by means of appropriate diagnostic plots or
formal tests. Limitations from un-fixable problems are
clearly noted. The actual estimation
of parameters, predictions, or other calculations are technically correct.  All calculations
based on estimates are clearly explained, and also technically correct.  All
estimates or derived quantities are accompanied with appropriate measures of
uncertainty. 

__Conclusions__ (8 / 8) The substantive questions are answered as
precisely as the data and the model allow.  The chain of reasoning from
estimation results about models, or derived quantities, to substantive
conclusions is both clear and convincing.  Contingent answers ("if $X$, then
$Y$, but if $Z$, then $W$") are likewise described as warranted by the
and data.  If uncertainties in the data mean the answers to some
questions must be imprecise, this too is reflected in the conclusions.
